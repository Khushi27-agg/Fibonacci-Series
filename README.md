# Fibonacci Series Program (C++)
# Overview

Day 8 of my daily coding challenge focuses on implementing the Fibonacci series using C++. The program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms using an iterative approach, ensuring efficient execution and minimal memory usage.

# Features

Generates Fibonacci series up to n terms

Uses an iterative method (no recursion overhead)

Simple and user-friendly console interaction

Efficient time and space complexity

Clear separation of logic using functions

# Key Concepts Used

Functions in C++

for loop

Conditional logic

Sequence generation

Pass-by-value

Console input/output

# Technologies Used

Language: C++

Library: <iostream>

▶ How to Run

Compile the program:

g++ fibonacci.cpp -o fibonacci


Run the executable:

./fibonacci


Enter the number of terms when prompted.

# Sample Output
Enter number of terms: 7
Fibonacci Series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8

🎯 Learning Outcome

This project improved my understanding of sequence-based algorithms, function usage, and iterative problem-solving in C++. It also reinforced best practices for writing clean and readable logic for fundamental algorithms like the Fibonacci series.
